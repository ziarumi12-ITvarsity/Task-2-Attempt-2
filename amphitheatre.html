                            <h3>AMPHITHEATER</h3>
    <p>Amphitheatre Gardens is a lovely park in the heart of Durbanâ€™s bustling Golden Mile where visitors can slip away from the crowds and enjoy the calm of the surrounding pond, fountains, and sub-tropical plants. Although situated near the entrance to North Beach, the park is generally vacant during the week, but comes alive with an art market most Sundays. A large flea market is also held here once a month where you can find everything from African curios to a curried pineapple on a stick.
